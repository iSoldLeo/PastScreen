## ✨ Highlights
- **Instant clipboard**: Every capture is immediately available as PNG + file path, optimized per app (VSCode/Zed/Cursor, browsers, design tools…).
- **Menu bar native**: Clean macOS menu-bar app with a simple menu, global hotkey (⌥⌘S) and optional Dock icon.
- **Liquid Glass overlay**: Custom selection window with translucent HUD styling and precise dimming.
- **Apple-native notifications**: UN notifications with Finder reveal, silent banners, and a "Saved" pill in the menu bar.
- **Sparkle auto-updates**: Secure updates delivered via Sparkle 2.8 with EdDSA signatures.
- **Shortcuts & Siri ready** (1.5): Capture area/full screen through App Intents, Automation and Spotlight.

## 🧩 Tech Stack
- **Swift 5.9**, AppKit + SwiftUI hybrid UI.
- **ScreenCaptureKit** for safe, high-quality captures.
- **Sparkle 2.8** for auto-updates.
- **TipKit & AppIntents** (macOS 14+)
- Localization: en, fr, es, de, it.
